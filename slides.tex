% Interview session; committee will ask some combination of the following:
% What are your career goals? Why OSoMe/IU? 
% Why are you interested in this NSF APTO project?
% What are you really good at professionally? What do you enjoy the most?
% What are you not good at or not interested in? What were the low points of your career?
% What were your biggest mistakes? What did you learn from them?
% What is an (or the most)  important question in your research area and why? Ideally, what would be needed to address it?
% Who were your senior colleagues in the past? How will they rate your research performance on a 1-10 scale when we talk to them? Why?
% Are you comfortable with software engineering and managing software projects? How do you manage your code and data? What do you do to ensure the reproducibility of your research?
% Do you have any experience in machine learning and embedding? 
% What are the most data- or computation-intensive computations you did?
% Have you had any opportunity to mentor junior students/collaborators? 
% During your postdoc appointment, would you be interested in teaching a course or writing grant proposals? Or would you prefer focusing on research?
% Do you prefer working alone or in a group? In the office or at home?
