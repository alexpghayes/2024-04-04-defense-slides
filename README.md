# Peer effects are parametrically indistinguishable from baseline behaviors in the asymptotic limit

A central idea in social networks is that friendships can influence individual outcomes. A classic example is contagion: if someone's friends get sick, they are more likely to get sick themself. Identifying peer effects has long been challenging. When people behave similarly to each other, it can quickly become difficult to distinguish between baseline behaviors and imitation, and while peer effects are known to be identified for many social structures, this finite sample identification is often weak. We show a concerning negative result: peer effects that are weakly identified in finite samples often become non-identifiable as social networks grow in size.
